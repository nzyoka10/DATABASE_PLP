#### Week 2: Lesson 1 - Entities & Attributes

## Overview

- In this lesson, we delve into the concept of entities within the context of database design.
- Entities represent real-world objects or concepts that we want to model and store data about. 

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Understanding Entities**:
    - Definition of entities and their significance in database design.
    - Examples of entities in various domains (e.g., `customers`, `products`, `orders`).

2. **Attributes of Entities**:
    - Identifying and defining attributes that describe entities.
    - Different types of attributes: simple attributes, composite attributes, and derived attributes.

3. **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**:
    - Introduction to ERDs as visual representations of entities, attributes, and relationships.
    - Basic symbols and notations used in ERDs.

## Practical Applications

- Identifying entities and their attributes is the first step in database design, laying the foundation for building efficient and structured databases.
- ERDs help visualize the relationships between entities, aiding in the understanding and communication of database structures.

## Assignment

- Review the lesson material on entities and attributes.
- Practice identifying entities and their attributes in different scenarios.
- Create a simple Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a domain of your choice to reinforce your understanding.
